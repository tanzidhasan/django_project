                                One of the added benefits of donating blood is having access to cholesterol levels. Results are readily available to you online so you can gage what you need to change in your diet, or you may just want to maintain healthy levels.<br>
                                <h3 class="popup-tertiary"><b>3. The Health Benefits from Donating Blood</b></h3>
                                Donating blood has many health benefits. Not only will you help someone in need of blood, but you will also help optimize your health and wellness. Here are the top three health benefits from donating blood.<br>
                                <b>a) Protect Your Heart by Reducing Oxidative Stress</b><br>
                                <ul class="l-class">
                                    <li>Iron in your blood can oxidize resulting in damage to your cells and tissues. The increase in oxidative stress is most dangerous to your cardiovascular system.</li>
                                    <li>According to a new study published by the American Medical Association, giving blood every six months led to fewer heart attacks and strokes in test participants ages 43 to 61.</li>
                                    <li>Excessive iron is thought to contribute to heart disease, especially at its early stages. Donating blood on a regular basis reduces the iron stores in the body and this study supports the theory that reducing iron appears to preserve cardiovascular health.</li>
                                    <li>A second study of 2,682 men in Finland, reported in the <i>American Journal of Epidemiology</i>, found that men who donated blood at least once a year had an 88 percent lower risk of heart attacks than non-donors.</li>
                                    <li>This same group of researchers published a follow-up study and found that men who donated blood were less likely than non-donors to show any signs of cardiovascular disease.[1]</li>
                                </ul>
                                <b>b) Protect Against Developing Cancer</b><br>
                                <ul class="l-class">
                                    <li>Give blood to help lower your risk of cancer. According to the Miller-Keystone Blood Center, consistent blood donation is associated with lowered risks for cancers including liver, lung, colon, stomach and throat cancers.[2]</li>
                                    <li>Risk levels dropped in correlation with how often participants donated blood. The association between lower cancer risk and donating blood might also stem from reducing oxidative stress. Free radical compounds can damage your DNA. Damaged genetic material is the hallmark of all cancers.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <b>c) Free Blood Analysis</b><br>
                                <ul class="l-class">
                                    <li>After donating, your blood will be tested for syphilis, HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), hepatitis and other factors. The center will notify you if tests show you may be unhealthy. Your blood will not be used if it could make someone sick.</li>                                        </li>

                                    By following a few recommendations before, during and after your blood donation can help you make your donation experience as safe, successful and pleasant as possible.<br>
                                <h3 class="popup-tertiary"><b>1. Before Your Donation</b></h3>
                                <ul class="l-class">
                                    <li>Maintain a healthy iron level in your diet by eating iron rich foods, such as spinach, red meat, fish, poultry, beans, iron-fortified cereals and raisins.</li>
                                    <li>Get a good night's sleep.</li>
                                    <li>Drink an extra 16 oz. of water and fluids before the donation.</li>
                                    <li>Eat a healthy meal before your donation. Avoid fatty foods, such as hamburgers, fries or ice cream before donating. Tests for infections done on all donated blood can be affected by fats that appear in your blood for several hours after eating fatty foods.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3 class="popup-tertiary"><b>2. During Your Donation</b></h3>
                                <ul class="l-class">
                                    <li>Wear clothing with sleeves that can be raised above the elbow.</li>
                                    <li>Let the phlebotomist know if you have a preferred arm and show the staff any good veins that have been used successfully in the past to draw blood.</li>
                                    <li>Relax, listen to music, talk to other donors or read during the donation process.</li>
                                    <li>Take the time to enjoy a snack and a drink in the refreshments area immediately after donating.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3 class="popup-tertiary"><b>3. After Your Donation</b></h3>
                                <ul class="l-class">
                                    <li>Drink plenty of fluids over the next 24-48 hours to replenish any fluids you lost during donation.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid strenuous physical activity or heavy lifting for about five hours after donation.</li>
                                    <li>If you feel light headed, lie down, preferably with feet elevated, until the feeling passes.</li>
                                    <li>In rare cases when bleeding occurs after removing the bandage, apply pressure to the site and raise your arm for 3-5 minutes. If bleeding or bruising occurs under the skin, apply a cold pack to the area periodically during the first 24 hours.</li>
                                    <li>If for any reason something doesn't feel right, then call a doctor.</li>
                                    <li>Enjoy the good feeling that comes with knowing that you may have saved some others live.</li>
